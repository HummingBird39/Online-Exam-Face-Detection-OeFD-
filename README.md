### :page_facing_up: CODING:
- Library packages needed:
- Steps needed in order to successfully install face_recognition package
  - Step 1: pip install cmake
  - Step 2: pip install dlib
  - Step 3: pip install face_recognition

- For every face successfully detected by the algorithm by applying our trained model, a green bounding box is placed on the student's face with their name displayed. (Face Recognition)
- The time of when the student enters the hall and exits the hall is recorded and saved in a csv file, as well as the image captured and detected timely throughout the exam. 

## GUI CODING USING QT DESIGNER:
- Qt Designer is used in creating the app interface for student's face detection before entering the virtual exam hall

### :page_facing_up: PROJECT RESULT:

- Result 1: student's face detected, student can proceed to enter the exam hall
- Result 2: In the virtual exam hall, student's face is detected and authenticated in a timely manner using a timer
- Result 3: The time and duration spent in the exam hall is recorded in a csv file
